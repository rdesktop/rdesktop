===========================================
rdesktop: A Remote Desktop Protocol client.
===========================================

rdesktop is a client for Microsoft Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows 2000
Terminal Services, Windows 2003 Terminal Services/Remote Desktop, Windows XP
Remote Desktop, and possibly other Terminal Services products.
rdesktop currently implements the RDP version 4 and 5 protocols.

Installation
------------
rdesktop uses a GNU-style build procedure.  Typically all that is necessary
to install rdesktop is the following:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

The default is to install under /usr/local.  This can be changed by adding
--prefix=directory to the configure line.

Note for CVS users
------------------
If you have downloaded a snapshot of rdesktop using CVS, you will first need to
run ./bootstrap in order to generate the build infrastructure.  This is not
necessary for release versions of rdesktop.

Invocation
----------
Simply run:

	% rdesktop server

where server is the name of the Terminal Services machine.  (If you receive
"Connection refused", this probably means that the server does not have
Terminal Services enabled, or there is a firewall blocking access.)

You can also specify a number of options on the command line.  These are listed
in the rdesktop manual page (run "man rdesktop").

Smart-card support notes
------------------------
The smart-card support module uses PCSC-lite. You should use PCSC-lite 1.2.9 or
later.

To enable smart-card support in the rdesktop just run "./configure" with the
"--enable-smartcard" option. Also you can enable smart-card debug with
additional "--with-debug-smartcard" option.
