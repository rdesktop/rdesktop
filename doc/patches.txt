URL:
http://bibl4.oru.se/projects/rdesktop/patch19/patches/backingstore+privatecolormap-for-19-3-9.patch
Description:
This adds support for 1) Private color maps (useful for 8 bpp mode)
and 2) backingstore selection. 
Status:
1) is not needed anymore; rdesktop automatically uses Private color
map in 8 bpp mode. 2) is, as far as I understand, also not
need. rdesktop automatically uses a software backing store if the
Xserver does not provide one.

URL:
http://bibl4.oru.se/projects/rdesktop/patch19/patches/fasttext2+nobackpixmap.patch
Description:
(From http://mail.rdesktop.org/archive/2001/msg00218.html):

* Added --no-backpixmap option to disable the ugly double drawing in
xwin.c (I have a very robust backing storage in my X, so I don't need
it ;)

* More optimizations to text draw (previous fast-text patch was
included in 192-3-6-2). In text drawing with solid background the
glyphs are drawn with stippled fill instead of XCopyPlane (runs faster
on my S3Trio64 with XFree 3.3.6, please test it on other
configurations to validate this). The WinTach not show any improvement
with this change, it seems to use all transparent background text
draws, but with a old PC Magazine Winbench (3.1) doing the scroll text
test the speed gain is significative.

* My Previous patch to disable backing storage in fullscreen
