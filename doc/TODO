* Implement support for RDP 5.X features, like cut-n-paste, sound and
  serial port redirection.

* Keymapping: Support non-dead versions of some dead keys, like
 "acute". It seems like RDP4 only supports the dead versions, but the
  non-dead ones can be simulated by sending a space after the dead
  key. 

* Keymapping: Autodetect which keymap to use.
