ANNOUNCING rdesktop 0.9.0alpha1
===============================

rdesktop is an open source client for Windows NT Terminal Server,
capable of natively speaking its Remote Desktop Protocol. No server
extensions are required.

0.9.0alpha1 is a milestone release including experimental support for
much of the protocol. It is NOT a stable, production-quality release.
Users should be prepared to submit bug reports and, ideally, patches.

The current X-Windows driver is rather limited - an Xlib guru's
assistance would be appreciated. In particular, this version requires
the X display to support windows of 8-bit depth, which in most cases
means running X in 8-bit mode. Keyboard mapping may also be problematic.

The -l option will disable licence negotiation, which is probably
what you want during testing.

Tested platforms include Linux, Solaris and OSF1, but it is should be
fairly straight-forward to port to other platforms and even windowing
systems.

rdesktop is released under the GNU Public License.
